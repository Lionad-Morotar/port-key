  "designPhilosophy": "Here is the design philosophy of PortKey:\n\n## Core Idea\n\nPortKey maps project names to numbers based on keyboard layout, making port numbers both readable and memorable.\n\n## Background Problem\n\nWhen you need to run multiple projects locally, choosing port numbers becomes troublesome:\n\n- There have been so many new projects over the last couple of years. To really try them out, you often need to boot them locally, which causes port collisions.\n- If you want to keep browser tabs (or bookmarks) stable, a project's port number shouldn't keep changing.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstead of picking random numbers, map project names to numbers based on the **keyboard**, so the port number is both **readable** and **memorable**.\n\n## Mapping Rule\n\nUsing a standard QWERTY keyboard, map each letter to a single digit based on its **row/column position**.\n\nExample:\n\n`\"cfetch\"` → `c(3) f(4) e(3) t(5) c(3) h(6)` → `34353` (port number)\n\nThen you can take the first 4 digits (e.g., `3435`), or keep more digits (e.g., `34353`). Either is fine.\n\n## Multi-Port Strategy\n\nIf a project needs multiple ports (frontend, backend, database, etc.), choose one of these two approaches:\n\n1. Use project prefix, then append a \"role suffix\"\n   - For `\"cfetch\"`, take `3435` as the base\n   - Frontend (`fe`, i.e., `43`) → `34354`\n   - Backend (`server`) → `34352`\n   - Database (`mongo`) → `34357`\n   - ...and so on\n\n2. Use project prefix, then assign sequential roles\n   - For `\"cfetch\"`, take `3435` as the base\n   - Web → `34351`\n   - Backend → `34352`\n   - Database → `34353`\n   - ...and so on\n\n## Port Range\n\n- Ports must be within **0–65535**.\n- For custom services, it's usually best to use **1024–49151** (non-reserved) or **49152–65535** (private/dynamic).\n- As long as the mapped number stays under the limit, it's valid.\n\nLearn more: https://lionad.art/articles/simple-naming-method"
